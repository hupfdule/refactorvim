Contributing to Refactorvim
===========================
:issue-tracker: https://github.com/hupfdule/refactorvim/issues

Refactorvim is only a small plugin made because of a personal need.
It is not well tested and will likely still have some bugs.

There is also enough room for improvements.

Anyone interested in contributing is highly welcome! This plugin should be
community driven.

If you think something is missing, found a bug or want to discuss further
development, please open a <<{issue-tracker}, ticket>>. And of course, be
prepared to provide Pull Requests.

If there is enough interest in this plugin it will likely be moved into its
own organization in github to not connect it too much with a personal
account.
