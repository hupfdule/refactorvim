- What to do if script-local variables and methods are used in a moved
  function?
  - Move together? What should happen if these are referenced somewhere
    else?
  - Stop moving the function?
  - Specify [!] to move / copy all script-local references?

- Support refactoring of autoload variables (global, but autoloaded)

- Renaming of autoload file asciidoc#search to asciidoc#sections did rename
  the file, but the content was not modified. All previous function names
  are still there.
